**CreakVC** is a tool based on [FreeVC](https://github.com/OlaWod/FreeVC) for researching the voice quality known as creaky voice or vocal fry. It additionally uses [creapy](https://gitlab.tugraz.at/speech/creapy) for measuring creak and plotting. 
CreakVC is able to take any good-quality single-speaker speech input and modify the degree of creaky voice present in the audio.  

CreakVC requires the following in order to work:
* Clone the CreakVC repository ````git clone https://github.com/Hfkml/CreakVC/````
* Download the CreakVC checkpoint
* Download [WavLM](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/wavlm) and save it in the folder ````wavlm/````
* Open CreakVC.ipynb
* Watch [this video](https://play.kth.se/media/Show%20and%20Tell%20/0_hpyq9vy1) for instructions
